                <h1>Honey Singh</h1>
    
    <p><font color="red">
        Hirdesh Singh</font> was born on <mark>15 March <font color="red">1983 </font>  in <mark><u>Karampura</u></mark>, West Delhi to Sardar Sarabjit Singh and Bhupinder Kaur in a Sikh family. Karampura was originally a refugee settlement area after the 1947 India-Pakistan partition. Singh's family were Lahori Sikh refugees from Lahore, Pakistan.[5]</p>

    <p>Singh used to play Tabla during his school days and initially wore a Turban as he is a Sikh, but his hair started forming dreadlocks naturally. Even after washing his hair thrice a week, his hair had no change, so his mother had to cut his hair when he was age 12 or 13. Singh narrates how the next day in school during the assembly, he wrapped a cloth on his head and the principal, after noticing him, pointed at him to get out. His father didn't talk to him for 2/2.5 years because of him cutting his hair and Singh left playing Tabla because of this incident and subsequently became an atheist.</p>

    <p>Singh states that he was only keen on gathering knowledge about religion but not practicing it. Throughout his life, he has been introduced to a variety of religions including Sikhism while growing up in a Sikh household, Hinduism from his spiritual guru, Abhinav Acharya Ji and Islam & Sufism during his youth days when he shifted to Mohali, Punjab in 2007.</p>

    <p>Singh later became a devotee of Hindu deity Lord Shiva during his recovery from Bipolar disorder.</p>

    <p>Singh did B.Sc. in I.T. in 2001 to get a computer from his family on which he could make beats and produce music while studying for his college.[9] He lived in a flat in Rohini Sector 3 given by his Acharya Ji after his father kicked him out. Singh credits his father for the exposure he received to music despite his father being against the idea of Singh entering the music industry. His father is fond of Mohammed Rafi's music which Singh claims used to be played on loop during his childhood. His father also had an expensive music system at home due to his love for music despite not having a very high paying job. Singh's mother was also a singer and still sings. Singh in particular, liked Kishore Kumar as he believed Kumar's songs to be more notorious.</p>

    <p>Given his interest in music, Singh traveled to the United Kingdom to study at the Trinity College Of Music.[11] After graduating, he came back to Delhi. He began his career as a recording artist and a Hip Hop, Bhangra music producer. His first claim to fame came when he received the ETC award for Best Sound for his song, Glassy in 2006    </p>
